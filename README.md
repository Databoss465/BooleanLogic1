# BooleanLogic1
This repository contains programs simulating and statistically summarizing the results of a boolean logic network modelling a certain intracellular signalling pathway. 
The vanilla network is simulated in Network1. 
The other programs simulate the network with two additional inhibitory nodes. 
Network2 - Network4 model the altered network under different initial conditions.
The results are summarized in the slides, comparing exh output with those of the original paper.
